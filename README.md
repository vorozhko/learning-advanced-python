# Advanced python examples

In this project I will test my skills in different advanced programming areas using Python.
By the end of this excercise the project will contain Python examples in different programming areas.
The fun part that resulting code might look sometimes simple and at the same time solving advanced problem.

## Topics

**Metaprogramming**:
* Write a Python decorator that logs the execution time of a function. [Example](./metaprogramming/log-exec-time.py) ✔️
* Create a metaclass that enforces a Singleton pattern for classes. [Example](./metaprogramming/singleton.py) ✔️

**Concurrency and Parallelism**:
* Implement a multi-threaded web scraper using the threading module.
* Use the multiprocessing module to parallelize a CPU-bound task.

**Functional Programming:**
* Implement a custom map function using only Python's built-in functions (no loops or list comprehensions).
* Write a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence using a generator.

**Data Structures and Algorithms:**
* Implement a binary search tree (BST) with insertion, deletion, and searching methods.
* Solve the traveling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm.

**Design Patterns:**
* Implement the Factory Method or Abstract Factory design pattern.
* Create a Python program using the Observer pattern.

**Advanced OOP:**
* Implement a custom context manager using __enter__ and __exit__ methods.
*  Create a class that behaves like a dictionary but supports dot notation for attribute access.

**Data Analysis and Visualization:**
* Use libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize a dataset.
* Implement a custom function for Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Web Development:**
* Build a RESTful API using a web framework like Flask or Django.
* Create a web scraping tool that collects data from a website and stores it in a database.

**Machine Learning:**
* Implement a simple neural network from scratch using only NumPy.
* Use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to build and evaluate a model on a dataset.

**Networking:**
* Create a simple chat application using sockets in Python.
* Implement a TCP server that handles multiple clients concurrently.

**Security:**
* Write a script to analyze the security of a website by checking for common vulnerabilities.
* Implement a basic encryption and decryption algorithm.

**Testing:**
* Write unit tests for a complex function or class using the unittest or pytest framework.
* Practice mocking external dependencies in your tests.

**Concurrency with asyncio:**
* Build a simple asynchronous web server using the asyncio library.
* Implement a program that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently using asyncio.

**Databases:**
* Create a Python script that interacts with a relational database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to perform CRUD operations.
* Implement a data migration script using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

**Advanced Python Libraries:**
* Explore advanced features of libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and pandas, and solve challenging data manipulation or scientific computing problems.
